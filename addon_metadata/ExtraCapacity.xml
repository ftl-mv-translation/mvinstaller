Are you a hoarder? Is 3 augment and 4 cargo slots not enough for you.

In which case this mini-addon is just for you!

Increases augment slots by 3 and cargo slots by 4 - and can be patched multiple times if you want even more!

Needed to be pathed after (below) mods that adds ships - otherwise ships added below this mod won't be affected!
